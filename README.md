# China-s-Economic-Reforms
## Introduction:
In 1978, the Chinese government made tremendous economic reforms in the bid to turn the country into a market-oriented economy. The changes were introduced through a radical reform movement by the government and had essentially been described as successful owing to
the results that have been noticed from the associated changes. During the first two decades after the introduction of the reforms, China realized over 10 % of economic growth rate of the country’s annual GDP (Chow 2004). These data are available in the world economic statistical trends of various countries’ economic growth or movements. There are various reasons that inspired the introduction of these reforms which are discussed in detail in this project proposal. The study also covers the major components of China’s economic reforms over three decades as well as the distinct characteristics of the reforms introduced in the country to transform it into a competitive market. Essentially, the major reform areas affected by the rapid change that would be highlighted in this project include the agricultural sector, changes experienced among the enterprises owned by the state and introduction of the open-door policy.
